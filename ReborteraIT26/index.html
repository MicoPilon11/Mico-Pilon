            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The Province of Bukidnon is located at the center of Mindanao Island, southern part of the Philippines. It is a landlocked province bounded on the North by the City of Cagayan de Oro, on the South by North Cotabato and Davao City, on the East by Agusan del Sur and Davao del Norte, and on the West by Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur.</p>
            <p>Occupying a wide plateau in the North Central part of Mindanao, Bukidnon has a progressive agriculture-based economy. Having the biggest agricultural area with soils and climate highly suited to agriculture, Bukidnon is the main source of agricultural products and raw materials that feeds the processing plants within the province and the major processing centers of the region. Hence, Bukidnon is tagged as the region’s “Food Basket”.</p>
            <p>Bukidnon is also labelled as the highland paradise in the heart of Mindanao. It is predominantly a rolling grassland plateau with an average elevation of 915 meters. The rolling uplands, deep canyons and valleys alternating with the low plains create a refreshing vista for dwellers and travellers alike. The refreshing cool climate in the Bukidnon plateau is attributed to its fairly high altitude.</p>
